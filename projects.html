<!-- Note: This webpage was built from scratch without any static generators, templates, or copying/pasting. I did it mainly as a learning experience in HTML/CSS/JS.As such there maybe (correction: are) a lot of bugs. In fact, if you're reading this you should probably stop and not look at the source code anymore. Pls. Everything is a huge, ugly mess down there. It's seriously terrible coding. I will cry. You will cry. It will be very embarassing. Wait for version 2.0. Seriously. End rant/plea.

Note: But if you're looking to give me hints/suggestions please do! It'd be greatly appreciated!  -->

<h1>Projects</h1>
  <h2>Hardware / Software</h2>
  <h3>Yelp Wannabe</h3>
  <p>  
    I built a command prompt application that scrapes Yelp for the user's search query and preferences. The version 1.0 only scraped for price, ratings, and number of reviews. Version 2.0 analyzed the comments and attempted to find the overall attitude in each of the reviews. Version 3.0 usuccessfully attempted to thread each review analysis to processes in parallel but this showed no significant improvement in run time. 
  </p>

  <h3>Lame Dictionary</h3>
  <p>
    I built a web scraper that looked at dictionary websites for basic definitions. This was my first project with webscraping. I am currently implementing a thesaurus that looks for synonyms based on intensity (positiveness / negativeness), usage, and context (professional / colloquial)
  </p>

  <h3>Remote Controlled Laptop</h3>
  <p>
    I used simple batch programming with basic VBA scripts to control my laptop with SMS messages. RC Laptop just has just has basic modes such as opening the browser and playing music. Intially, I used Outlook to trigger rules but I decided to replace it with my Lame Mail application.
  </p>

  <h3>Lame Mail</h3>
  <p>
  I built a command prompt based email checker (a Mutt rip-off) as a way to learning how to use the python url library. It was one of my first python programs.
  </p>

  <h3>ECG</h3>
  <p>
  I designed and built the a working electrocardiogram (ECG) to accurately measure my heart rate. It used chains of low pass filters and op-amps to clean up the signal but addional open source software was used to get a better-looking reading. 
  </p>

  <h3>Biofilters</h3>
  <p>
  I designed cheap biofilters made of woodchips, gravel, and compost to filter nitrates and phosphates out of agricultural run-off. Varying ratios of these three biomedia were tested to determine the optimal ratio for run-off reduction. The projet place 1st at the Greater San Diego Science and Engineering Fair and eventually made it to the California State Science Fair.
  </p>


  <h2>Other</h2>
  <p>
  Here are some of my projects with wood working. Though not really relevant towards computer science, they were a lot of fun!
  </p>

  <h3>Shoe rack</h3>
  <p>
  I designed and built a shoe rack from scratch using less than $15 of materials. Most of the wood was scavenged from abandoned furniture and curbside give aways. Power tools (drill and circular saw) were borrowed for free from the Berkeley Public Library.
  </p>

  <h3>Uncle's house</h3>
  <p>
    I helped my uncle build his house by installing the foundation and floor for the catwalk in the attic as well as installing the roof rafters and shingles. I also cut and created the header frames for the arches in the living room and kitchen door. This project was extremely enjoyable as I was able to apply both my engineering knowledge and technical skills. This project lasted 3 months (summer vacation).
    </p>

  <h3>Catapult</h3>
  <p>
    My friend and I decided to recycle my housemate's old bed foundation and turn it into a catapult. About $5 was spent on the PVC catapult arm and rubber bands. Lots of planning went into design but most of it was scraped when we actually started working on it. About one afternoon was spent actually building it. It's range is about 25 feet.
  </p>

  <h3>Desk</h3>
  <p>
    I helped design and build my friend's desk. She wanted something as cheap and simple as an Ikea $30 desk. This was about $20 since we couldn't scavenge any large pieces of wood.
