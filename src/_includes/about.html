                    <p class="text-muted">I'm a software engineer living in SF that graduated Cal '15 EECS. I'm a machine learning wannabe, seeker of random trivia, binge consumer of martial arts movies, and aspiring professional eater. I'm currently a full stack engineer at <a href="https://captricity.com/"> Captricity.</a>. While you're here, take a look at my projects below and feel free to let me know if you like/dislkike anything and maybe we can build something together!</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">When I'm not getting destroyed by work (self-inflicted), I really enjoy learning how to make new applications and projects. Recently, I've been building Smaug- a rails project for my uncle's business. You might ask me if I do anything but loaf around in front of my computer. The answer to that is no. Because I recently bought a tablet. I loaf around in front of that too. Just kidding. Maybe. </p>

                    <p class="text-muted">But seriously speaking, my goal is to see the world so I enjoy camping and traveling. Just recently I visited Europe and Iceland. My other hobbies include soccer every week, boxing thrice a week, and volunteering at random events. </p>
