Smaug was built over winter break of my senior year for my uncle who own's a smog check business (hence the pun). It takes scanned pdf images and extracts the fields into a database for easy retrieval. My uncle was having a hard time remembering which customer's visited and what they came in for so he requested that I make Smaug to help replace his room full of cabinents and paper invoices.
