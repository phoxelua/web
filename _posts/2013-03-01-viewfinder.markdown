Viewfinder was built at Facebook Hackathon with my good friend and housemate Jason Won. It was my first hackathon and the first time I ever tried web development. Neither of us did not even know how to use Flask, Heroku, or Javascript. But it was so fun that this hackathon ended up being one of the primary reasons I decided to switch from Bioengineering to EECS. This amazing experience made me truly understand how powerful and easy it is for a person with a computer and internet access to build amazing, fun apps.

Suprising the Heroku app is still running now- you can go check it out <a href="http://viewfinder.herokuapp.com/">here</a>! And if you'd like to see our horrendous code (there's seriously a git conflict in the README, no joke) take a look <a href="https://github.com/jjwon/Viewfinder">here</a>.
