<!-- Note: This webpage was built from scratch without any static generators, templates, or copying/pasting. I did it mainly as a learning experience in HTML/CSS/JS.As such there maybe (correction: are) a lot of bugs. In fact, if you're reading this you should probably stop and not look at the source code anymore. Pls. Everything is a huge, ugly mess down there. It's seriously terrible coding. I will cry. You will cry. It will be very embarassing. Wait for version 2.0. Seriously. End rant/plea.

Note: But if you're looking to give me hints/suggestions please do! It'd be greatly appreciated!  -->

    <h2>EECS Undegraduate</h2>
  <p>I am an undergraduate student currently studying electrical engineering and computer science at UC Berkeley. But more specifically, I'm a big programming enthusiast and computer science wannabe. So far I've gained experience in data structures, algorithms, and machine structures. Though computer science can often be challenging, I find it both enjoyable and very rewarding. This year I am an academic intern for CS61A and an electircal engineering intern for the Berkeley CITRUS lab. </p>
  <p>I was born in San Diego, California. I have two sisters, an older and a younger. My parents immigrated to America during the Vietnam War and have worked very hard to send us all to college. I am very grateful to both of them.</p>
  <p>Aside from schoolwork, I really enjoy learning and making new wannabe applications and trying new wannabe hacking projects. Most of my projects include topics outside of school so they often end up being horendous conglomerates of code. But as a result I end up learning a lot from my many, many mistakes. Some of you might ask me if I do anything but loaf around in front of my computer. The answer to that is no. Just kidding. Maybe. But seriously speaking, I also enjoy building things, especially with wood, in my spare time. Other than that I just like eating and running.</p>

					<p> Hi! I'm a junior majoring in electrical engineering and computer science at UC Berkeley. I'm a big programming enthusiast and computer science wannabe.</p>
					<p> Aside from schoolwork, I really enjoy learning and making (or trying to, at least) new applications and hacking new projects. You might ask me if I do anything but loaf around in front of my computer. The answer to that is no. Just kidding. Maybe. But seriously speaking, I also enjoy building things, especially with wood, in my spare time. Other than that I just like eating and running.</p>
