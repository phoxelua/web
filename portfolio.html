<!-- Note: This webpage was built from scratch without any static generators, templates, or copying/pasting. I did it mainly as a learning experience in HTML/CSS/JS.As such there maybe (correction: are) a lot of bugs. In fact, if you're reading this you should probably stop and not look at the source code anymore. Pls. Everything is a huge, ugly mess down there. It's seriously terrible coding. I will cry. You will cry. It will be very embarassing. Wait for version 2.0. Seriously. End rant/plea.

Note: But if you're looking to give me hints/suggestions please do! It'd be greatly appreciated!  -->

<h1>Work Experience</h1>
  <h3>Berkeley CITRUS Lab, Electrical Enginering Intern <div id="date">5/2013 - Present</div></h3>
  <p>
    I researched and designed some prototypes for small-scale electric power generators over the summer with my graduate student supervisor. Though the designs for the bicycle pump generator and piezoelectric shoes were mine, my supervisor was the one who provided the guidance and technical knowledge I deeply lacked. The programming of the Arduinos to output interesting results (like generating primes or Fibonacci numbers) was also done by me. We are currently refining the designs and transitioning into the prototyping phase. 
  </p>  

  <h3>CS61A, Academic Intern <div id="date">8/2013 - Present</div></h3>
  <p>
    My duties as an academic intern mostly involved helping the teaching assistants run office hours, discussion, and lab sections. In any case, this required me to teach and help students basic computer science concepts like recusion, abstraction, and inheritance. During office hours, I primarily helped students debug their programs and answer practice midterm questions.
  </p>  

  <h3>Flowbit, Software and Electrical Enginering Intern <div id="date">7/2013 - 8/2013</div></h3>
  <p>
    I worked with a team of three other engineers to design, program, and test an Arduino-based prototype that remotely monitors water usage in Third World countries. On the hardware side, I designed and integrated the Arudino with GPS shield, GPRS shield, RTC, and flow meter. On the software side, I programmed the Arduino to send SMS, receive GPS information, and process flow meter data. Since we wanted the meter to monitor as long as possible without maintenance, we optimized code to use as little power as possible by maximizing sleep time and reducing expensive operations.

 <h3>San Francisco Paramedic Association, Emergency Medical Technician<div id="date">7/2012 - 8/2013</div></h3>
  <p>
    I provided emergency medical care for 911 calls. My scope of practice ranged from CPR, AED, airway management, and trauma. I also worked clinical hours at Berkeley Fire Department and Kaiser in Oakland. When I was off duty, mainly on the weekeds, I consistently volunteered at SFPA clinical exams.

  <h3>Kearney Mesa Smog Check, Mechanic &amp Assistant<div id="date">7/2012 - 8/2013</div></h3>
  <p>
    As an assistant, I helped run smog checks and do basic car repairs. I also did miscellaneous duties such as recording smog check data, fixing and painting the fence, repainting the shop, and cleaning.

<h1>Projects</h1>
  <h2>Hardware / Software</h2>
  <h3>Yelp Wannabe</h3>
  <p>  
    I built a command prompt application that scrapes Yelp for the user's search query and preferences. The version 1.0 only scraped for price, ratings, and number of reviews. Version 2.0 analyzed the comments and attempted to find the overall attitude in each of the reviews. Version 3.0 usuccessfully attempted to thread each review analysis to processes in parallel but this showed no significant improvement in run time. 
  </p>

  <h3>Lame Dictionary</h3>
  <p>
    I built a web scraper that looked at dictionary websites for basic definitions. This was my first project with webscraping. I am currently implementing a thesaurus that looks for synonyms based on intensity (positiveness / negativeness), usage, and context (professional / colloquial)
  </p>

  <h3>Remote Controlled Laptop</h3>
  <p>
    I used simple batch programming with basic VBA scripts to control my laptop with SMS messages. RC Laptop just has just has basic modes such as opening the browser and playing music. Intially, I used Outlook to trigger rules but I decided to replace it with my Lame Mail application.
  </p>

  <h3>Lame Mail</h3>
  <p>
  I built a command prompt based email checker (a Mutt rip-off) as a way to learning how to use the python url library. It was one of my first python programs.
  </p>

  <h3>ECG</h3>
  <p>
  I designed and built the a working electrocardiogram (ECG) to accurately measure my heart rate. It used chains of low pass filters and op-amps to clean up the signal but addional open source software was used to get a better-looking reading. 
  </p>

  <h3>Biofilters</h3>
  <p>
  I designed cheap biofilters made of woodchips, gravel, and compost to filter nitrates and phosphates out of agricultural run-off. Varying ratios of these three biomedia were tested to determine the optimal ratio for run-off reduction. The projet place 1st at the Greater San Diego Science and Engineering Fair and eventually made it to the California State Science Fair.
  </p>


  <h2>Other</h2>
  <p>
  Here are some of my projects with wood working. Though not really relevant towards computer science, they were a lot of fun!
  </p>

  <h3>Shoe rack</h3>
  <p>
  I designed and built a shoe rack from scratch using less than $15 of materials. Most of the wood was scavenged from abandoned furniture and curbside give aways. Power tools (drill and circular saw) were borrowed for free from the Berkeley Public Library.
  </p>

  <h3>Uncle's house</h3>
  <p>
    I helped my uncle build his house by installing the foundation and floor for the catwalk in the attic as well as installing the roof rafters and shingles. I also cut and created the header frames for the arches in the living room and kitchen door. This project was extremely enjoyable as I was able to apply both my engineering knowledge and technical skills. This project lasted 3 months (summer vacation).
    </p>

  <h3>Catapult</h3>
  <p>
    My friend and I decided to recycle my housemate's old bed foundation and turn it into a catapult. About $5 was spent on the PVC catapult arm and rubber bands. Lots of planning went into design but most of it was scraped when we actually started working on it. About one afternoon was spent actually building it. It's range is about 25 feet.
  </p>

  <h3>Desk</h3>
  <p>
    I helped design and build my friend's desk. She wanted something as cheap and simple as an Ikea $30 desk. This was about $20 since we couldn't scavenge any large pieces of wood.
  </p>

<h1>Activities</h1>
  <h3>Bach Van Kung Fu, Instructor and Student</h3>
  <p>
    I have put this on hiatus since I've been away for college but when I'm not busy with school my duties included helping organize belt tests and teaching students basic forms and kicks. But as a student, I engaged in numerous form and sparring competitions. I started in martial arts when I was 8 years old so I've been in the program for more than 10 years now.
